"""Target-model `agent_factory` selection by backend flag.

    openrouter     — the SDK's OpenAIResponsesAgent pointed at OpenRouter (needs internet + an
                     OPENROUTER_API_KEY). Network-bound → safe to run many replays concurrently.
    kaggle_gguf    — the on-Kaggle GGUF/llama-cpp path used by the official local-validation
                     notebook (needs a GPU, `llama-cpp-python`, and the public model datasets;
                     works offline). Single model in GPU memory → run serially.
    deterministic  — the SDK's `VulnerableDeterministicAgent` (no weights, no network) — for
                     fast CI smoke tests of the guard + scorer.

The **judge** is **not** an independent axis: it runs on the *same* backend and target model as the
agent under test (see `judge_agent` below, wired from `runner.replay_one`'s `(backend, target)`). The
only explicit override is `PRIVATE_GUARD_JUDGE_BACKEND=mock` — an opt-in no-judge stub for CI.
