"""A realistic stand-in for the unseen *private* competition guardrail.

This is **not** the public `OptimalGuardrail` and **not** a predicate-mirror. It is one
complete, layered defense-in-depth policy that gives *some* protection against all four
predicates by reasoning about **content and authorization** instead of names/keywords.

Two cooperating layers per privileged tool call:

  1. **1st line — fast, specific deterministic checks** (deny short-circuits):
       * EXFIL — DLP on the outbound payload of exfil sinks (after reversible decodings),
                 regardless of filename. Does NOT honor a bare ``SECRET_MARKER``.
       * U2A   — content-aware taint: an injection *classifier* on untrusted (web/email)
                 read OUTPUT (via a POST_TOOL_CALL hook), not pure provenance. Tainted ->
                 deny the next privileged action within a short TTL window.
       * DW    — read-before-write content sensitivity: block clobbering a file whose
                 *bytes* we saw were sensitive, and block blind deletes. No filename list.
  2. **2nd line — a universal LLM-as-judge** over every privileged action the 1st line
     allowed (see ``private_eval_proxy/private_judge.py``). It is uniquely responsible for the CD case
     (non-injection unauthorized share / ambient authority) and acts as a holistic catch-all
     for the other axes. **Deny-if-either** layer denies.

Each axis has an *organic* blind spot (documented inline) so the stand-in behaves like a
real, imperfect guard rather than a mirror of the scorer.

**No fallbacks** (see ``no-fallbacks-prefer-noisy-failure`` memory): ``llm-guard`` is a hard
dependency imported at module load — a missing dep raises ``ImportError``. There are no
heuristic detectors. The judge likewise raises rather than degrading. Everything here lives
outside the vendored SDK — import-only; it must run on a *fresh install* of the SDK (see
``.claude/plans/the-private-env-will-mossy-flame.md`` and the ``sdk-fresh-install-constraint``
memory).
