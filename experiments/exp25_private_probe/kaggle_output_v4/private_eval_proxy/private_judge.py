"""LLM-as-judge for the private-guard stand-in — the universal 2nd line of defense.

Built on the SDK's *own* agent path (`AgentProtocol.next_action`). The judge is **not a separately
configured backend**: it runs on the *same* backend and target model as the agent under test, wired
through from `runner.replay_one`'s `(backend, target)` via the guardrail. The lone explicit override
is ``PRIVATE_GUARD_JUDGE_BACKEND=mock`` — an opt-in no-judge stub for CI (no model, no network).

Design constraints (see plan ``the-private-env-will-mossy-flame`` + memories):
  * **Reuse SDK machinery only** — every LLM call goes through `OpenAIResponsesAgent` /
    `build_agent_factory`; no raw ``chat.completions`` / ``responses.create`` anywhere.
  * **No bespoke cache** — symmetric with the SDK's uncached target-model path; one
    `next_action` per judgment, so judge tokens are faithfully counted in the budget.
  * **No fallback** — a missing/invalid backend, a non-final decision, or unparseable text
    all **raise** (never silently default allow/deny).
  * The run's `CostAccountingSink` is attached so judge tokens flow into the token budget
    exactly like the target agent's.
